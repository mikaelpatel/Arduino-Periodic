# Arduino-Periodic

This library provides syntactic sugar to allow periodic blocks in
Arduino sketches that require multiple periodic behavior.

## Install

Download and unzip the Arduino-Periodic library into your sketchbook
libraries directory. Rename from Arduino-Periodic-master to Arduino-Periodic.

The Periodic library and examples should be found in the Arduino IDE
File>Examples menu.
